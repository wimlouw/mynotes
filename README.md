I was curious about creating websites with R Markdown!

I got a blog up and running.

I followed Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill’s book “blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown” for set-up.

This was wonderfully easy.

For now I’m just updating a “resources” list that includes tools and articles I find interesting, and plan to add a few tutorials.

(Other things that were useful: I made some tweaks to the “lithium” theme in the layouts folder including: getting external links to open in a new tab (see this post) in the “footer.html” file, and added Google Tag Manager in the “head_custom.html” file.)
