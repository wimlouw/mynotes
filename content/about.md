I was curious about creating websites with R Markdown! 

I followed Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill's book "[blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) for set-up.

This was wonderfully easy.

For now I'm just updating a "resources" list that includes tools and articles I find interesting. 

Other things that were useful:
- I made some tweaks to the ["lithium"](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-lithium-theme/) theme in the layouts folder including:
  - Getting external links to open in a new tab (see [this post](https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/target-blank/)) in the "footer.html" file
  - Google Tag Manager in the "head_custom.html" file
