I am currently a Research Manager at [J-PAL Africa](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/africa). I work on projects in youth employment, and education. Before joining J-PAL Africa, I worked as a researcher in the South African non-profit sector. 

This site is a personal project.

I was curious about creating websites with R Markdown! 

I followed Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill's book "[blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) for set-up.

This was wonderfully easy :)
