I am currently a data scientist at the City of Cape Town in South Africa.

Before this, I was a Research Manager at [J-PAL Africa](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/africa) where I worked on projects in youth employment, and education. 

This site is a personal project.

I was curious about creating websites with R Markdown! 

I followed Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill's book "[blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) for set-up.

This was wonderfully easy :)
