I was curious about creating websites with R Markdown! 

I followed Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill's book "[blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) for set-up.

This was wonderfully easy.

For now I'm just updating a "resources" list that includes tools and articles I find interesting.
