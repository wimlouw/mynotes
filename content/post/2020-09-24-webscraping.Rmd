## Intro

A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to work as a Research Associate on a cool labour market study. Part of this study involved looking for suitable job vacancies online and applying for jobs on behalf of jobseekers in the study. This involved aggregating as many job postings as possible, across a number of sites, selecting an appropriate subset of jobs (by location, experience, and other employer requirements), before, finally, screening and curating the jobs we intended to apply to. This happened across multiple rounds. This, as you can imagine, takes a bit of work! And it did, but, thankfully we managed to automate part of it using webscraping scripts to pull jobs from websites.[^1] In the process, I was able to learn a bit about how to programmatically extract information from websites using R, rvest, and [R Selenium](https://docs.ropensci.org/RSelenium/).[^2]

[^1]: In practice, this aggregation process involved both webscraping, and a fair amount of manual searching!

What is webscraping about? Well it's mostly about getting the things you're seeing on a web page (or across many pages) into a form you can work with on your computer, i.e. make it a dataset, a list, or whatever. This might be a single table or multiple tables across many pages, or it might be a combination of elements, like job ads with associated information (title, location, area, salary, date, &c.)

In essence, this is basically a data extraction and cleaning exercise! In the examples below, it's about getting the content you want from the HTML (**parsing**).

In more complicated cases, it involves automating interacting with the web page (using a web driver like Selenium), to reveal the content you want. Once you have the content, in a form you can work with, it's standard data cleaning stuff (manipulating strings, dates, &c.[^3]).

[^3]: Check out [R for Data Science's](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) chapters on dates and strings; then: (1) [Simple, Consistent Wrappers for Common String Operations • stringr,](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) (2) [GitHub - trinker/textclean: Tools for cleaning and normalizing text data,](https://github.com/trinker/textclean) (3) [Quantitative Analysis of Textual Data • quanteda](https://quanteda.io/) (text analysis)

A lot of the work involves figuring out how the website works: where the information you want is, choosing the right **css-selectors**, working with URLs[^4], figuring out how to **iterate** (i.e. "crawl") across pages.

[^4]: See Julia Evans' "[how URLs work](https://wizardzines.com/comics/how-urls-work/)"; also see Oliver Keyes & Jay Jacobs' "[urltools](https://github.com/Ironholds/urltools)" R package --- not something I'm getting into, but I think working with URLs programmatically is the way to go!

Then, if you want to build something more sophisticated, it might involve working with a database, a scheduler, and other tools.[^5] E.g. you might want to build something that extracts information regularly, and stores it in a database.

[^5]: Have a look at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and their "Hobby-dev" PostgreSQL with the fee Heroku scheduler

The examples below are all quite basic, but the aim is really to convey some key concepts, and to make you see what's possible.

## Considerations

There are a few things to consider before investing time in writing a script to extract information from a web page (or pages):

-   **Is this already available?** Perhaps it can be downloaded from the site as a spreadsheet already (have a look around), or perhaps the site has an API[^6] you can access to download data

-   **Is there a low effort way of doing this?** For instance, maybe you can just copy-paste what you need into a spreadsheet or directly into R[^7]? Or maybe there's a product or function you can use straight away[^8]

-   **How much copy-paste/ "low-effort" work are we talking here?** I think writing a simple script can, in many cases, be the lowest effort of all, but one might hesitate because it feels too daunting. If you'll need to copy-paste multiple things across multiple pages, rather write a script! Related: **Is this a once-off thing, or do I plan on doing this regularly?** Automate with a script!

-   **Is it OK for me to do this?** This is a trickier question. It depends. And sometimes it's hard to tell! Things you can do: check if the site has a `robots.txt` file[^9] (which, if a site has one, includes do's and don't for scrapers/crawlers); ask yourself "would I feel OK about this information being pulled from my website?". If you decide to scrape --- be polite about it: don't overwhelm the site. Don't bother the site more than you need to, i.e. don't send too many requests to a website per second. You can avoid this by trying to be efficient (don't repeatedly query the website), and/or including some rests in your code, to slow things down, and to emulate regular browsing.

## Some minimal conceptual stuff

### The front-end of the web[^10]

[^10]: See [here](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/introduction/) and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)

-   **HTML** -- basic content and layout semantics (adding structure to raw content)

-   **CSS** -- adding styles (formatting, colours, sizes of things, sometimes where things are placed, &c.)

-   **JavaScript** - making things interactive (behaviour of things on the page)

[Here](https://codepen.io/rcyou/pen/QEObEk/) is an example on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) bringing these together. You can also see how these come together by using your browser's inspect tool. On Chrome you can right click and select "inspect" or go to More Tools/ Developer Tools[^11].

[^11]: See <https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open>

Here's what it looks like:

## Tools

-   [rvest](https://github.com/tidyverse/rvest) --- "rvest helps you scrape information from web pages"[^12]

-   [SelectorGadget](http://selectorgadget.com/) --- "point and click CSS selectors"

-   [tidyverse tools](https://www.tidyverse.org/) --- for data manipulation

[^12]: Pretty complete examples on how to use rvest here: <http://rvest.tidyverse.org/>

## Examples

### Set up, due diligence

I'll be using the following packages:

```{r}

library(tidyverse) ## for data manipulation (various packages)
library(rvest) ## for scraping
library(textclean) ## some cleaning functions
library(robotstxt) ## to get robotstxt protocols
library(kableExtra) ## for printing out an html table in this post

```

I'm going to be scraping from wikipedia.org and gumtree.co.za. I want to check if it's OK to do that. Wikipedia has a robots.txt, and it seems OK to scrape here if you're going to be polite about it:

```{r}

rtxt_wikipedia <- robotstxt(domain="wikipedia.org")
replace_html(str_trunc(rtxt_wikipedia$text, 500, "right"))

```

As for gumtree.co.za, I'm finding it hard to interpret the exclusions criteria...I think I'll just be very polite ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Examples

### Tables

I want to get the website HTML

```{r}

## get the website HTML
website <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_South_Africa") 

```

Now I want to identify the table I'm seeing so I can parse it from the HTML.

Hmmm, OK, this is actually tricky on Wikipedia, I can't find the specific css-selector on this page.

But something you an do is to get all tables on the page, and then try to identify which one is the right one using string matching:

```{r}

table <- html_nodes(website, "table") ## all tables
length(table) ## how many tables?

## I want the one that contains "ANC"
data <- html_table(table[grep("ANC", table)], fill = T)[[1]]

## let's see
glimpse(data)
head(data) ## great

```

### Other elements

Let's try something else. Getting job information on gumtree.co.za

Things to note here: descriptions are truncated, and contact information is hidden (i.e. you need to click on these elements to reveal them). For the purposes of these examples, we're not going to get into headless browsers, and how to get your script to interact with page elements (but this is possible!)

Let's try a single job:

```{r}

jobs <- read_html("https://www.gumtree.co.za/s-jobs/page-1/v1c8p2?q=entry+level")

links <-
  jobs %>%
  html_nodes(".related-ad-title") %>%
  html_attr("href")

head(links)

```

Great now I have all the links on page 1.

I want to look at the first one, and extract some information:

```{r}

jobs_1 <- read_html(paste0("https://www.gumtree.co.za", links[1]))

title <- jobs_1 %>%
  html_nodes("h1") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  str_squish()

title

```

I will need to do this for a bunch of things --- title, description, &c. So I'm going to make a small function to make that easier:

```{r}

## function for cleaning single elements
cleanup <- function(site, tag) {
  output <- site %>%
    html_nodes(tag) %>%
    html_text() %>%
    str_squish()
  output <- ifelse(length(output) == 0, NA, output) ## in case an element is missing
  return(output)
}

## let's try it out
description <- cleanup(jobs_1, ".description-website-container")
jobtype <- cleanup(jobs_1, ".attribute:nth-child(4) .value")
employer <- cleanup(jobs_1, ".attribute:nth-child(3) .value")
time <- Sys.time()

## and put it into a tibble
dat <-
  tibble(
    title,
    description,
    jobtype,
    time
  )

dat ## looks good

```

What if I wanted to do this for all ads on this page?

### Iteration

I have the links from the first page. I want to extract all the information I specified above for each one. I think I'll write another function, which will create a tibble for every link, and then I'll put this into a list of tibbles using a for loop:

```{r}

## function for cleaning all elements I want on a page
cleanup2 <- function(x) {
  page <- read_html(x)
  title <- cleanup(page, "h1")
  description <- cleanup(page, ".description-website-container")
  jobtype <- cleanup(page, ".attribute:nth-child(4) .value")
  employer <- cleanup(page, ".attribute:nth-child(3) .value")
  time <- Sys.time()
  dat <-
    tibble(
      title,
      description,
      jobtype,
      time
    )
  return(dat)
}

## fixing the link
links <- paste0("https://www.gumtree.co.za", links)
links <- sample(links, 5)

## a list, and a for loop
output <- list()
for (i in 1:length(links)) {
  deets <- cleanup2(links[i])
  deets$title
  output[[i]] <- deets # add to list
  Sys.sleep(1)
}

all <- bind_rows(output)


```

OK, let's see what this looks like (I'm truncating job descriptions for display):

```{r}

## truncate
all$description <- str_trunc(all$description, 100, "right")

## using kable to make an html table for the site
all %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_paper(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)

```

I just did the first page. How would one do other pages? One approach is to use the URL and another for loop.

```{r}

pages <- 3 ## let's just do 3
job_list <- list()
link <- "https://www.gumtree.co.za/s-jobs/page-"

for (i in 1:pages) {
  jobs <-
    read_html(paste0(link, i, "/v1c8p2?q=entry+level"))
  links <-
    jobs %>%
    html_nodes(".related-ad-title") %>%
    html_attr("href") # get links
  job_list[[i]] <- links # add to list
  Sys.sleep(1)
}

links <- unlist(job_list)
head(links, 10) ## looks good!

```

### Things to think about

Make sure your script can handle errors.[^13]

[^13]: See "safely" and "possibly" from the purrr package

-   css-selectors change
-   links stop working
-   not all pages are necessarily the same (some elements may be missing from some site) --- see the "job type" variable above, for instance
-   sites time out (that can break your script if you don't account for it)
-   &c.
